entire training set.

Answers to questions 1 and 2 are in ps4questions.pdf. Questions 3c and 3d are answered at
the top of the income.py file.

A representation of the top three levels of the tree is shown in incomestree.pdf.
The dot file that it was generated from is included.

The plots for max_depth and min_samples_leaf values vs. training and validate scores
are in the following two image files:
	max_depths vs training and validate scores.png
	min_samples_leafs vs training and validate scores.png

The data used is included in the ps4_data folder.
